### Introduction to Chaty Chaty: A Simple Chat App for TDPnet

Welcome to Chaty Chaty, your go-to example for building a basic yet functional chat application on the TDPnet platform. Ideal for those just starting out with TDPnet, this chat app serves as a foundational project for developing peer-to-peer applications.

#### Simple and Customizable
Chaty Chaty is designed to be easy to understand, allowing you to modify it according to your unique needs. It's the perfect starting point for anyone looking to get into TDPnet development.

#### Minimal Dependencies
The app relies solely on Bootstrap for styling, which doesn't impact its core functionality. You can switch it out or upgrade as you see fit.

#### Quick Setup: Accessing the Network
To connect to the TDPnet network, simply update the 'credentials' section with your access key, password, and address.

#### Chat with Peers
To start chatting, add the address of the desired peer under the 'peers' section. If you're eager to dive in right away, just leave the 'peers' section as is—you'll get echo responses for now. But keep an eye out, as we're working on integrating an LLM model called Feuler that will provide more interesting responses soon!

#### Scalability and Customization
While the basic version of Chaty Chaty supports chatting with just one peer, it's structured in a way that developers can easily extend it to support multiple peers.

#### Notifier Class
Our Notifier class is designed to work with a single session by default, but its functionality can be customized to suit your specific requirements.

#### Unleash Your Creativity
With Chaty Chaty, the sky's the limit for developers! Modify it, scale it, integrate it with other services—make it your own.
