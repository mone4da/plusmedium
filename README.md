Welcome to PlusMedium, an innovative experimental project designed to explore the capabilities and functionalities of TDPnetâ€”our cutting-edge Software-Defined Networking (SDN) technology, powered by a proprietary routing protocol.

As a developer, you'll engage with TDPnet as a Service Provider, responsible for building robust systems across a TDPnet deployment.

What is a System?
A system comprises a coordinated ensemble of Service Providers working collaboratively to achieve application-specific objectives, typically outlined as requirements.

Getting Started
Kickstart your development journey with our pre-designed templates. Navigate to agent/YOUR_FRAMEWORK/00X to begin. Currently, we offer templates for Node.js, with plans to expand our framework support. Your contributions to this expansion would be highly valued.

Thank you for joining PlusMedium! We're excited to see what you'll create.
